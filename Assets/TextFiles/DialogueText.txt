Ensure not to catch fishes that are too small. This affects the marine biodiversity. Marine biodiversity refers to the many different fishesin the world's oceans and seas. Laws have size limits to protect small fish, so they can grow and reproduce to make sure there will be plenty of fish to catch in the future.

Endangered fish species are protected by law. Fishing for endangered species affects marine biodiversity because the extinction of a fish species would lead to there not being
enough fishes for fishermen to catch for food. With no valuable fish left in the waters to fish, the fishing industry is on the verge of collapse. The yellowfin grouper is an example of an endangered fish. Try to catch less of them.

The maximum amount of fishes to be caught (40 fishes) has been reached. Avoiding overfishing is important because there may 
be less fish available in the sea, which can lead to the overpopulation of plankton which is the
main food for fish. Too much plankton contaminates the sea leading to the disturbance of
tourism and human activities such as fishing and swimming thereby causing problems for the economy.
